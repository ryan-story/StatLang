Script to delete open-sas package from PyPI using Warehouse API.

Note: PyPI typically requires web interface for deletion, but this script
attempts to use the API if available. You may need to use the web interface
at https://pypi.org/manage/projects/

Usage:
    export PYPI_USERNAME=your_username
    export PYPI_PASSWORD=your_password_or_token
    python3 delete_open_sas.py
